Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Zoopa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by Zoopa using the default payment method designated in your Account, after which Zoopa will send you a receipt by email.

Zoopa may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This payment structure is intended to fully compensate the Third Party Provider for the services or goods provided. Any representation by Zoopa (on Zoopa's website, in the Application, or in Zoopa's marketing materials) to the effect that tipping is "voluntary," "not required," and/or "included" in the payments you make for services or goods provided is not intended to suggest that Zoopa provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above, to the Third Party Provider. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Third Party Provider who provides you with services or goods obtained through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary.
